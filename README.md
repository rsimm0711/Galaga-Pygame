# Asteroids-Pygame

This is a simple game made with Python 2.7 and Pygame. It has basic implementation/functionality but I have plans to add more to it.

You will need to clone the repository and have Python installed to run the game. I used Spyder to run the file. 

How To Play:

SPACE - fires a bullet

LEFT ARROW - moves your ship left

RIGHT ARROW - moves your ship right

The objective of the game is to shoot down enemies for as long as you can until you lose. You lose when an enemy ship reaches
the bottom of the screen without being shot down. In this case, the program will close and print "GAME OVER" to the console.

The wonderful spaceships are made by MillionthVector!
